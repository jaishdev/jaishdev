## In Progress

I’ve previously deployed a learning-focused project to get hands-on experience with development and deployment. Here is the link [cozynest](https://cozynest-jd6g.onrender.com/listings)
Right now, I’m building a more complete, production-style web application — with a clean UI, solid backend, and real-world features. Built with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB  
Includes authentication, dynamic routing, and a fully responsive frontend UI. 
Excited to share it here soon.
